# Progress / Handoff

A running journal: what shipped per version, decisions that *aren't* captured in a build plan,
and what's next. Read the **build plans** for scope, rationale, wireframes, and per-milestone test
lists; read **this** for current state and the cross-cutting knowledge the plans can't carry.

**Plan versions**
- [build-plan-1.0.md](build-plan-1.0.md) — frozen v1 brief (M0–M5). Shipped.
- [build-plan-1.1.md](build-plan-1.1.md) — singles improvements (M6–M10). Shipped.
- [build-plan-1.2.md](build-plan-1.2.md) — archived releases (M11). Shipped.

Newer plan versions go in new `build-plan-N.N.md` files; older ones stay frozen.

**Current state:** v1.2 done and verified. Tests green (`dotnet test` — domain 40 / API 54).
Next work is in [Backlog / next steps](#backlog--next-steps).

## Journal

**v1 (M0–M5) — foundation.** Domain (entities, template-copy, progress, derived status, validation,
seed), the minimal API + EF/SQLite with seeded templates, and the React SPA (dashboard, artists,
release form + detail checklist, templates editor, album tracklist). M5 was polish: 375px mobile
pass, filters, empty states, and the multi-stage Dockerfile.

**v1.1 (M6–M10) — singles improvements.** UPC/ISRC + the soft "missing identifier" warning (only
after *Distribute to DSPs* is checked); per-task timeframes (`MinDaysBefore`/`MaxDaysBefore`, max
drives calc, Pre-only) + surfaced notes; the dashboard split into **Home** (`scope=home`,
forward-looking) and **All Releases** (`scope=all` table); and the **pending-actions** engine
(`PendingActions.Compute` → `GET /api/pending` + a detail "Needs attention" block). The single
template grew 30 → **31** (Distribute inserted as 3rd Pre); album unchanged at **40**.

**v1.2 (M11) — archived lifecycle.** `Archived` release status + a soft-delete ("Remove"):
`ArchivedAt`/`DeletedAt` on Release, `POST /api/releases/{id}/archive` (guarded to `releaseDate >=
today`, not-twice), `DELETE /api/releases/{id}` repurposed to a guarded soft-delete (archived only),
`scope=archived`, the `/releases/archived` page (linked from All Releases, not a nav item), Archive
on Home cards + All Releases rows, and a read-only archived detail. Verified end-to-end via the
running API + browser SPA.

**Post-M10 fix:** the soft UPC/ISRC warning was a hover-only `title` tooltip (dead on touch); it's
now a tappable button with a dismissable popover ([IdentifierWarning.tsx](src/Zmg.Web/src/components/IdentifierWarning.tsx)).

## Cross-cutting decisions (not in any single plan)

- **Status is derived, never stored** — recomputed from tasks + date on every read. The **one**
  exception is `Archived` (v1.2), a persisted flag that overrides the derived value.
- **Soft-delete, never hard-delete** (v1.2). Removed releases are stamped `DeletedAt` and hidden by a
  global query filter (`HasQueryFilter(r => r.DeletedAt == null)`) so stable ids survive for phase-2
  stats. EF logs a benign "required end of a relationship" advisory for the child navs.
- **Template-copy-on-create is backend logic, wired since v1** — a release is born with a full
  snapshot checklist. Editing a template never touches existing releases (covered by
  `TemplateApiTests.Editing_a_template_does_not_touch_existing_releases`).
- **Reorder is move-up/move-down, not drag-and-drop.** The order endpoint takes the full ordered id
  list for a phase; the UI posts a single-swap result. Dependency-free, mobile-friendly; the endpoint
  already supports arbitrary orderings if DnD is added later.
- **Mutations return the single changed DTO** (or 204); the detail screen holds a flat task array and
  recomputes phase groups + progress client-side, so no re-fetch. Moving a task across phases appends
  to the target (`SortOrder = max+1`).
- **Tracks key off `TrackNumber`** (1-based, contiguous) for both order and display; reorder rewrites
  it, delete renumbers survivors. Tracklist is UI-gated to `type === Album` (endpoints aren't hard-scoped).
- **Create/update release responses are `{ data, warnings }`** (`CreatedWithWarnings<T>`) so
  non-blocking validation warnings reach the form.
- **Enums serialize as integers** (System.Text.Json default); the TS layer mirrors (`ReleaseType.Single
  = 0`, …). Change both sides together. `erasableSyntaxOnly` is disabled in `tsconfig.app.json` so TS
  `enum`s compile.
- **Web is organized by feature folder** (`src/Zmg.Web/src/features/{home,releases,artists,templates}`),
  not flat `pages/` — an earlier refactor (#1). Shared UI in `components/`, API client in `api/`,
  types in `types/`.

## Run

```bash
# dev (two terminals)
dotnet run --project src/Zmg.Api                 # API on :5274 (default profile)
cd src/Zmg.Web && npm install && npm run dev     # SPA on :5173, proxies /api → :5274

# prod-style (one process)
cd src/Zmg.Web && npm run build                  # → src/Zmg.Api/wwwroot
dotnet run --project src/Zmg.Api                 # serves SPA + API together

dotnet test                                      # full suite
```

DB is `src/Zmg.Api/zmg.db` (git-ignored, migrated on startup). Delete it to reset.

## Project layout

```
src/Zmg.Domain   entities/enums, template-copy, progress, status, validation, seed,
                 identifier-state, pending-actions  (pure, no I/O)
src/Zmg.Api      minimal API: endpoints, service layer (+ interfaces), DTO contracts, extensions
src/Zmg.Infra    EF Core + SQLite: ZmgDbContext (seeding) + migrations
src/Zmg.Web      React + Vite + Tailwind SPA, organized by feature folder
tests/Zmg.Domain.Tests   xUnit unit tests
tests/Zmg.Api.Tests      integration tests (WebApplicationFactory + in-memory SQLite)
```

## Backlog / next steps

- **Phase 2 — DSP stats** (the reason this exists over Notion/Trello): hang streaming/revenue data off
  the stable Artist / Release / Track ids and UPC/ISRC columns. Needs a schema pass.
- **Per-track task fan-out** on albums: registrations that repeat per track are single "per track"
  tasks today. Decide after the first real album.
- **Verify the Docker image** on a machine with the daemon running (`docker build -t zmg-tracker .`) —
  written and reviewed, never built here (daemon was down).
- Deferred: un-archive/restore and hard-delete/purge (archives are terminal by rule); auth for hosted
  deploys; absolute per-task due dates (v1.1 only added timeframe *ranges*).

**Env note:** `npm run lint` fails locally — oxlint's native binding (`oxlint.darwin-universal.node`)
is missing, same class as the Vite 8 rolldown binding (Vite is pinned to 7.x for that reason). Use
`tsc --noEmit` + `npm run build` to typecheck until it resolves.
